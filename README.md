# Bookmaniac

This is a simple web app to manage your own book collection, made with Angular 6. It uses OpenLibrary's API to search for book titles, and then stores the data locally on your browser.

## How to run

- Clone this repository;
- Run `npm install` to install the app's dependencies;
- Run `npm start` to start the app. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to access Bookmaniac.

## Initial Load

Bookmaniac will initially load itself with some dummy data, so you can test the app's features more easily. This data can be deleted anytime on the "My Collection" page.
